# Biocompute Object Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assistant

[Sean Kim](https://github.com/seankim658)

## Background

The BioCompute Object (BCO) project is a community-driven open standards framework for standardizing and sharing computations and analyses. With the exponential increase in both the quantity and complexity of biological data and the workflows used to analyze and transform the data, the need for standardization in documentation is imperative for experimental preservation, transparency, accuracy, and reproducability.

As with any documentation standard, the main hurdles to continued adoption are the overhead required to maintain the quality and accuracy of a BCO in parallel as the research evolves over time and retroactively documenting pre-existing research. With the recent improvements in large language models (LLMs), the feasibility and utility of an automated BCO creation assistant is an intriguing use case.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to reduce the overhead required in retroactively documenting pre-existing research. By using the Biocompute RAG assistant, you can seamlessly convert existing publications on previous research to be BCO compliant.
