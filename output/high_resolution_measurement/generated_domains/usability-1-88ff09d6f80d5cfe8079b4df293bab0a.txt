    "Develop a novel method for high-resolution measurement of DUF1220 domain copy numbers from whole genome sequence data, enabling the distinction of all six DUF1220 clades and providing gene-specific resolution. This method aims to enhance the analysis of the role these sequences play in human variation and disease."
