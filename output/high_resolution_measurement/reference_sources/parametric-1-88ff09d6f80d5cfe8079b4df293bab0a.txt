METHODOLOGY ARTICLE Open Access
High resolution measurement of DUF1220
domain copy number from whole genome
sequence data
David P. Astling1, Ilea E. Heft1, Kenneth L. Jones2and James M. Sikela1*
Abstract
Background: DUF1220 protein domains found primarily in Neuroblastoma BreakPoint Family ( NBPF ) genes show
the greatest human lineage-specific increase in copy number of any coding region in the genome. There are 302
haploid copies of DUF1220 in hg38 (~160 of which are human-specific) and the majority of these can be divided
into 6 different subtypes (referred to as clades). Copy number changes of specific DUF1220 clades have been
associated in a dose-dependent manner with brain size variation (both evolutionarily and within the human
population), cognitive aptitude, autism severity, and schizophrenia severity. However, no published methods can
directly measure copies of DUF1220 with high accuracy and no method can distinguish between domains within
a clade.
Results: Here we describe a novel method for measuring copies of DUF1220 domains and the NBPF genes in
which they are found from whole genome sequence data. We have characterized the effect that various
sequencing and alignment parameters and strategies have on the accuracy and precision of the method and
defined the parameters that lead to optimal DUF1220 copy number measurement and resolution. We show that
copy number estimates obtained using our read depth approach are highly correlated with those generated by
ddPCR for three representative DUF1220 clades. By simulation, we demonstrate that our method provides sufficient
resolution to analyze DUF1220 copy number variation at three levels: (1) DUF1220 clade copy number within
individual genes and groups of genes (gene-specific clade groups) (2) genome wide DUF1220 clade copies and
(3) gene copy number for DUF1220-encoding genes.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first method to accurately measure copies of all six DUF1220 clades
and the first method to provide gene specific resolution of these clades. This allows one to discriminate among
the ~300 haploid human DUF1220 copies to an extent not possible with any other method. The result is a greatly
enhanced capability to analyze the role that these sequences play in human variation and disease.

Background
Highly duplicated sequences, including genes, are preva-
lent throughout the human genome [1]. While they have
been linked to important evolutionary [2, 3] and medical
phenotypes [4], they often go unexamined in studies of
genetic disease due to their complexity. Thus, there is a
growing need to develop improved strategies for accuratecopy number determination of highly duplicated se-
quences. While a number of methods exist for scoring
copy number variations (CNVs) (e.g. array comparative
genomic hybridization (arrayCGH), SNP arrays, qPCR,
ddPCR and read depth from exome sequencing) these
methods are not ideal for high-resolution measurement of
DUF1220 domains due to limitations in throughput, ac-
curacy and/or coverage. The primary challenge for both
array based methods and exome sequencing lies in the
hybridization efficiency of each probe with its respective
target and thus causing variance and resulting uneven* Correspondence: james.sikela@ucdenver.edu

# plethora

Plethora is a tool kit for copy number variation (CNV) analysis of highly
duplicated regions.  It was tailored specifically for the DUF1220 domain which
is found in over 300 copies in the human genome. However it could be applied to
other high copy domains and segmental duplications. The details are published [here](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-3976-z):

## Dependencies

Plethora depends on the following software. Note that updates to samtools and
bedtools may break plethora due to recent parameter changes

- [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) version 2.2.9
- [Bedtools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) version 2.17.0
- [Samtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net) version: 0.1.19-44428cd
- [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io) v1.12
- Perl module: Math::Random
- Perl module: Math::Complex

You will also need to download the human genome hg38 and build a Bowtie index
for it. Instructions for doing this can be found on the Bowtie2 website.

A script for installing the dependencies is included `code/install_tools.sh`


## Quick Start

The following illustrates the minimal steps necessary to run the pipeline. The
test data are simulated reads for a single DUF1220 domain, so this should run
relatively quickly versus a full WGS data set. The following code can also be used to
test that your environment has been set up correctly and that the installed
software is working.

1. Create directories for the resulting files (if they don't exist already)

```bash
mkdir alignments
mkdir results
```

2. Trim low quality bases from the 3' ends of the reads and remove any that are
shorter than 80 bp. Since we are working with simulated data, we don't expect
many reads to be effected by this.

```bash
cutadapt \
 -a XXX -A XXX -q 10 --minimum-length 80 --trim-n \
 -o fastq/test_1_filtered.fastq.gz \
 -p fastq/test_2_filtered.fastq.gz \
 fastq/test_1.fastq.gz \
 fastq/test_2.fastq.gz
```

3. Align reads to the genome with Bowtie2. Note you may have to change the path to point to your Bowtie2 reference


```bash
code/bowtie2.sh \
 -g $HOME/genomes/bowtie2.2.9_indicies/hg38/hg38 \
 -b alignments/test.bam \
 fastq/test_1_filtered.fastq.gz \
 fastq/test_2_filtered.fastq.gz
```

4. Calculate coverage for each DUF1220 domain


```bash
code/make_bed.sh \
 -r data/hg38_duf_full_domains_v2.3.bed \
 -p "paired" \
 -b alignments/test.bam \
 -o results/test
```

The resulting file `test_read_depth.bed` has the coverage for each domain. The reads were
simulated from NBPF1\_CON1\_1 at 30x coverage. Based on prior work, we expect to
find that most reads align to NBPF1\_CON1\_1, but some reads will map to one of
the other CON1 domains of NBPF1 or to NBPF1L.

The results should look something like this

```bash
awk '$2 > 0' results/test_read_depth.bed
```

    NBPF1_CON1_1   28.2794
    NBPF1L_CON1_1  2.55338
    NBPF1_CON1_2   0.66548
