METHODOLOGY ARTICLE Open Access
High resolution measurement of DUF1220
domain copy number from whole genome
sequence data
David P. Astling1, Ilea E. Heft1, Kenneth L. Jones2and James M. Sikela1*
Abstract
Background: DUF1220 protein domains found primarily in Neuroblastoma BreakPoint Family ( NBPF ) genes show
the greatest human lineage-specific increase in copy number of any coding region in the genome. There are 302
haploid copies of DUF1220 in hg38 (~160 of which are human-specific) and the majority of these can be divided
into 6 different subtypes (referred to as clades). Copy number changes of specific DUF1220 clades have been
associated in a dose-dependent manner with brain size variation (both evolutionarily and within the human
population), cognitive aptitude, autism severity, and schizophrenia severity. However, no published methods can
directly measure copies of DUF1220 with high accuracy and no method can distinguish between domains within
a clade.
Results: Here we describe a novel method for measuring copies of DUF1220 domains and the NBPF genes in
which they are found from whole genome sequence data. We have characterized the effect that various
sequencing and alignment parameters and strategies have on the accuracy and precision of the method and
defined the parameters that lead to optimal DUF1220 copy number measurement and resolution. We show that
copy number estimates obtained using our read depth approach are highly correlated with those generated by
ddPCR for three representative DUF1220 clades. By simulation, we demonstrate that our method provides sufficient
resolution to analyze DUF1220 copy number variation at three levels: (1) DUF1220 clade copy number within
individual genes and groups of genes (gene-specific clade groups) (2) genome wide DUF1220 clade copies and
(3) gene copy number for DUF1220-encoding genes.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first method to accurately measure copies of all six DUF1220 clades
and the first method to provide gene specific resolution of these clades. This allows one to discriminate among
the ~300 haploid human DUF1220 copies to an extent not possible with any other method. The result is a greatly
enhanced capability to analyze the role that these sequences play in human variation and disease.

Background
Highly duplicated sequences, including genes, are preva-
lent throughout the human genome [1]. While they have
been linked to important evolutionary [2, 3] and medical
phenotypes [4], they often go unexamined in studies of
genetic disease due to their complexity. Thus, there is a
growing need to develop improved strategies for accuratecopy number determination of highly duplicated se-
quences. While a number of methods exist for scoring
copy number variations (CNVs) (e.g. array comparative
genomic hybridization (arrayCGH), SNP arrays, qPCR,
ddPCR and read depth from exome sequencing) these
methods are not ideal for high-resolution measurement of
DUF1220 domains due to limitations in throughput, ac-
curacy and/or coverage. The primary challenge for both
array based methods and exome sequencing lies in the
hybridization efficiency of each probe with its respective
target and thus causing variance and resulting uneven* Correspondence: james.sikela@ucdenver.edu
