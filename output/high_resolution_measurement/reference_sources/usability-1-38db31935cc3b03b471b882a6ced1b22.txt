METHODOLOGY ARTICLE Open Access
High resolution measurement of DUF1220
domain copy number from whole genome
sequence data
David P. Astling1, Ilea E. Heft1, Kenneth L. Jones2and James M. Sikela1*
Abstract
Background: DUF1220 protein domains found primarily in Neuroblastoma BreakPoint Family ( NBPF ) genes show
the greatest human lineage-specific increase in copy number of any coding region in the genome. There are 302
haploid copies of DUF1220 in hg38 (~160 of which are human-specific) and the majority of these can be divided
into 6 different subtypes (referred to as clades). Copy number changes of specific DUF1220 clades have been
associated in a dose-dependent manner with brain size variation (both evolutionarily and within the human
population), cognitive aptitude, autism severity, and schizophrenia severity. However, no published methods can
directly measure copies of DUF1220 with high accuracy and no method can distinguish between domains within
a clade.
Results: Here we describe a novel method for measuring copies of DUF1220 domains and the NBPF genes in
which they are found from whole genome sequence data. We have characterized the effect that various
sequencing and alignment parameters and strategies have on the accuracy and precision of the method and
defined the parameters that lead to optimal DUF1220 copy number measurement and resolution. We show that
copy number estimates obtained using our read depth approach are highly correlated with those generated by
ddPCR for three representative DUF1220 clades. By simulation, we demonstrate that our method provides sufficient
resolution to analyze DUF1220 copy number variation at three levels: (1) DUF1220 clade copy number within
individual genes and groups of genes (gene-specific clade groups) (2) genome wide DUF1220 clade copies and
(3) gene copy number for DUF1220-encoding genes.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first method to accurately measure copies of all six DUF1220 clades
and the first method to provide gene specific resolution of these clades. This allows one to discriminate among
the ~300 haploid human DUF1220 copies to an extent not possible with any other method. The result is a greatly
enhanced capability to analyze the role that these sequences play in human variation and disease.

Background
Highly duplicated sequences, including genes, are preva-
lent throughout the human genome [1]. While they have
been linked to important evolutionary [2, 3] and medical
phenotypes [4], they often go unexamined in studies of
genetic disease due to their complexity. Thus, there is a
growing need to develop improved strategies for accuratecopy number determination of highly duplicated se-
quences. While a number of methods exist for scoring
copy number variations (CNVs) (e.g. array comparative
genomic hybridization (arrayCGH), SNP arrays, qPCR,
ddPCR and read depth from exome sequencing) these
methods are not ideal for high-resolution measurement of
DUF1220 domains due to limitations in throughput, ac-
curacy and/or coverage. The primary challenge for both
array based methods and exome sequencing lies in the
hybridization efficiency of each probe with its respective
target and thus causing variance and resulting uneven* Correspondence: james.sikela@ucdenver.edu

Assignment of DUF1220 domains to appropriate clade
As previously described, the majority of DUF1220 do-
mains can be divided into 6 clades [10]. The domains of
each clade can be distinguished by their position within
the gene, their exon lengths (Additional file 5), and pro-
tein sequence motifs unique to each clade (Additional file
6). We assigned each DUF1220 domain to a clade based
on the presence or absence of these characteristic protein
sequence motifs. The validity of our clade assignments
can be confirmed by viewing a phylogenetic tree of the
protein sequences (Fig. 1). Furthermore, because the
amino-acid motifs particular to each clade are highly
conserved within clades, it is easy to view the distinctions
between clades by viewing the aligned protein sequences
(Additional file 6).
Some (16/302) DUF1220 domains do not fit well
within the previously established clades, but clearly
form 5 distinct clusters based on sequence similarity.
We have therefore established five new clades referred
to as CON4 –8 (Additional file 5). In contrast to the
domains belonging to the six clades described above,
the majority of these DUF1220 domains are located be-
tween 1p11.2 and 1p13.3. These were not analyzed in
this study because of their non-canonical nature and
their locations predominately within non- NBPF genes.
A few (6/302) DUF1220 domains appear to be hybrid
domains, that is, they contain a short exon characteris-
tic of one domain and the long exon characteristic of a
different domain. These domains were not included in
our analysis.
Individual DUF1220 domains are referred to by their
gene name, the name of the clade to which the domain
belongs, and a number reflecting the placement of that
domain within the gene. For example, NBPF1_CON1_3
refers to the third CON1 domain within NBPF1 and
NBPF20_HLS1_8 refers to the eighth HLS1 domain
within NBPF20 . Six DUF1220 containing genes currently
lack formal gene names in either RefSeq or Ensembl but
each of these has high sequence similarity to another
gene (e.g. LOC102724250 is very similar to NBPF1 ). For
clarity, in Additional file 5 and Additional file 2: Figure S1,
we refer to these genes by descriptive names reflecting
their similarity to named genes (LOC102724250: NBPF1L,
LOC100996724: PDE4DIPL1 , RP11-744H18.1: PDE4-
DIPL2 ). The three genes containing CON8 domains are
similar to one another but not to any currently named
gene, so they are referred to as CON8 containing 1, 2, and
3 (LOC105369199: CON8C1, LOC105369140: CON8C2 ,
LINC00869: CON8C3 ). In Additional file 5 we also label
some exons as conserved exon 1 –7 (CE1-CE7) because
the sequence of these exons is highly conserved across
genes and, for CE1-CE3, at multiple locations within
genes. Several non-coding exons also have high sequence
similarity across genes and these are labeled UTR1-UTR20 (e.g. the sequence of UTR13 exons is highly con-
served across different genes). Exons that do not meet any
of the conditions described above are referred to as “exon ”
with a number denoting the exon position in the gene.
Measurement of DUF1220 by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)
We performed ddPCR essentially as previously described
[17] to validate our copy number estimates for three rep-
resentative DUF1220 clades. DNA samples were obtained
from Coriell Biorepository and digested with the restric-
tion enzyme DDE1. Digested DNA, primers, and fluores-
cently labeled probes were then combined following the
manufacturer ’s protocol.

may be the use of different genome assemblies [11]. The
most recent assembly (hg38), which was used for our
study, has a more completely finished 1q21 region [16]
where the majority of NBPF genes reside. The hg38
assembly includes a better annotation of NBPF14 ,w h e r e
NBPF14 expanded from 2 HLS triplets (in hg19) to 7
triplets in hg38. NBPF14 sequences were either missing
from the genome reference or were improperly assigned
when the previous estimates were reported by Sudmant et
al. 2010 [21].
Discussion
We describe a novel approach for the copy number meas-
urement of DUF1220 protein domain family sequences
and the genes that encode them (primarily NBPF )f r o m
WGS data. While some DUF1220 copies are indistin-
guishable from one another [10], the method described
allows the 302 haploid copies of DUF1220 (hg38) to be
accurately quantified at multiple levels of increased
resolution (clade, group-specific clade, and in some cases,
individual domains).
Through computational simulations, we were able to
identify the sequencing and alignment parameters that
lead to optimal measurement of DUF1220 copy number
inNBPF genes. When we tested multiple alignment strat-
egies for their alignment rates, accuracy and precision and
observed different levels of performance for the different
methodologies used. The alignment strategies tested had
different strengths. For example, the ‘Align All ’strategy
worked well to summarise the overall copies of CON1
and CON2 domains where zero off-target alignments
were detected. However, errors were much higher for
CON3 and HLS1 –3 due to greater sequence similarity
amongst domains from these clades. The off-target rates
for these domains were between 25 and 50%. This effect
can be partially mitigated by the ‘Best Align ’strategy.
Among our key findings was the determination that lon-
ger sequence read-lengths increased our ability to reliably
follow copy number changes for specific DUF1220 do-
mains. This may seem obvious, but it differs from a
commonly employed model that shortens reads to
36 bp [21, 24, 25]. We also determined that, while it is
difficult to accurately measure most individual
DUF1220 domains, we can accurately quantify the
number of domains within each clade and within each
gene (or small group of genes). The strategy of finding
all possible alignments for each read as a
summarization strategy was found to be inaccurate due
to the heterogeneous nature of the sequence similarity
of the domains. Finding the best possible alignment for
each read and choosing among the ties at random was
the most accurate and the most computationally effi-
cient strategy. The ‘best ’alignment strategy along withthe use of long sequencing reads allowed for the high-
est specificity and lowest off-target alignments.
To our knowledge, this is the first high-throughput
method that allows DUF1220 copy number to be mea-
sured with clade-specific resolution, and the first method
to measure clade copy number within specific NBPF
genes. The ability to obtain clade-specific resolution has
considerable significance in that variation in the copy
number of specific DUF1220 clades has previously been
shown to be associated with important phenotypic vari-
ation related to brain size [11 –14, 27], disease [17 –19] and
cognitive function [20], and this method should allow fu-
ture studies to be carried out with greatly increased speed
and cost-effectiveness relative to previous methods
(e.g. aCGH, ddPCR). For example, the large WGS
datasets that are being generated for autism [28, 29]
and other brain-related disorders should provide a
rich resource to which the DUF1220 read depth ap-
proach can be applied. Applications of this method to
study the biological variation of DUF1220 across the
human population are currently underway and will be
reported in follow on publications.
Conclusions
The significance of the work presented here is in the de-
velopment and validation of a computational, WGS strat-
egy to estimate copies of DUF1220 domains, at the clade,
gene, and domain level. As we demonstrate, previously
published computational methods for measuring CNVs
lack the ability to resolve DUF1220 into clades or other
smaller groupings.

# plethora

Plethora is a tool kit for copy number variation (CNV) analysis of highly
duplicated regions.  It was tailored specifically for the DUF1220 domain which
is found in over 300 copies in the human genome. However it could be applied to
other high copy domains and segmental duplications. The details are published [here](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-3976-z):

> Genomics. 18:614. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-3976-z

## Dependencies

Plethora depends on the following software. Note that updates to samtools and
bedtools may break plethora due to recent parameter changes

- [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) version 2.2.9
- [Bedtools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) version 2.17.0
- [Samtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net) version: 0.1.19-44428cd
- [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io) v1.12
- Perl module: Math::Random
- Perl module: Math::Complex

You will also need to download the human genome hg38 and build a Bowtie index
for it. Instructions for doing this can be found on the Bowtie2 website.

A script for installing the dependencies is included `code/install_tools.sh`


## Quick Start

The following illustrates the minimal steps necessary to run the pipeline. The
test data are simulated reads for a single DUF1220 domain, so this should run
relatively quickly versus a full WGS data set. The following code can also be used to
test that your environment has been set up correctly and that the installed
software is working.

1. Create directories for the resulting files (if they don't exist already)

```bash
mkdir alignments
mkdir results
```

2. Trim low quality bases from the 3' ends of the reads and remove any that are
shorter than 80 bp. Since we are working with simulated data, we don't expect
many reads to be effected by this.

```bash
cutadapt \
 -a XXX -A XXX -q 10 --minimum-length 80 --trim-n \
 -o fastq/test_1_filtered.fastq.gz \
 -p fastq/test_2_filtered.fastq.gz \
 fastq/test_1.fastq.gz \
 fastq/test_2.fastq.gz
```

3. Align reads to the genome with Bowtie2. Note you may have to change the path to point to your Bowtie2 reference


```bash
code/bowtie2.sh \
 -g $HOME/genomes/bowtie2.2.9_indicies/hg38/hg38 \
 -b alignments/test.bam \
 fastq/test_1_filtered.fastq.gz \
 fastq/test_2_filtered.fastq.gz
```

4. Calculate coverage for each DUF1220 domain


```bash
code/make_bed.sh \
 -r data/hg38_duf_full_domains_v2.3.bed \
 -p "paired" \
 -b alignments/test.bam \
 -o results/test
```

The resulting file `test_read_depth.bed` has the coverage for each domain. The reads were
simulated from NBPF1\_CON1\_1 at 30x coverage. Based on prior work, we expect to
find that most reads align to NBPF1\_CON1\_1, but some reads will map to one of
the other CON1 domains of NBPF1 or to NBPF1L.

The results should look something like this

```bash
awk '$2 > 0' results/test_read_depth.bed
```

    NBPF1_CON1_1   28.2794
    NBPF1L_CON1_1  2.55338
    NBPF1_CON1_2   0.66548
