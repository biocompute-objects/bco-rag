#### 4. (Optional) Remove temporary files

```bash
bsub < code/1000genomes/4_batch_clean.sh
```

This script removes intermediate files from earlier stages of the pipeline. This is useful because WGS files can take up a lot of disk space. This script first confirms that files from previous steps have been run correctly before removing them. 

By default it assumes that the number of reads in the fastq file are
correct (verified via checksum or read counting). Optionally you can provide a
file with the expected number of reads. The script deletes the file from a
prior step if the file in the next step has the correct number of reads (e.g.
delete the original bam file if the sorted bam has the correct number of
reads and delete the sorted bam if the resulting bed file has the correct number
of reads).

If the data have been downloaded from a public repository like the 1000 Genomes, this script can remove the fastq files by passing an optional flag.

The script assumes the `.bam` file contains unaligned reads (e.g. the number of reads in the fastq file should match the number of reads in the .bam file).

Behind the scenes the clean script runs `code/clean_files.pl`. For more information on how to run this directly:

```bash
code/clean_files.pl -h
```


#### 5. Calculate coverage for each region of interest

```bash
bsub < code/1000genomes/5_make_bed.sh
```

This script: 

  - Coverts the .bam alignment file into bed format
  - Parses the reads
  - Calls the `merge_pairs.pl` script (described below) to combined proper pairs into a single
fragment
  - Finds overlaps with the reference bed file containing the regions of interest
(e.g. DUF1220)
  - Calculates the average coverage for each region: (number of bases that
overlap) / (domain length)


#### 6. (Optional) Remove temporary files

```bash
bsub < code/1000genomes/6_batch_clean.sh
```

This script is a link to the script above. At this stage it can remove the alignment and fastq files if present.


#### 7. Correct coverage for GC bias

```bash
bsub < code/1000genomes/7_batch_gc_correction.sh
```

This script performs the GC correction step using conserved regions that are
assumed to be found in diploid copy number. This script requires the `_read.depth.bed` file 
generated in step 5 above as well as a file with the percent GC content for each domain.

Behind the scenes, this shell script calls `code/gc_correction.R` which can be run manually like so:

```bash
code/gc_correction.R results/HG00250_read.depth.bed data/hg38_duf_full_domains_v2.3_GC.txt
```

## Other useful scripts

#### preprocessing\_1000genomes.R

This script is how we selected the ~300 samples from the full `sample.index`
file for the 1000 Genomes Project. It filters out the exome sequencing data,
selects samples with reasonably high coverage, etc. It tries to collect
representative samples from each of the populations.


#### gc\_from\_fasta.pl

This script calculates the percent GC content for a set of domains and is called
by the batch script above. Required are a set of domains in .bed file format and
a .fasta file for the genome reference


#### build\_gc\_model.sh

This an LSF script for submitting a specific version of the DUF1220 annotation
to the LSF queue.


#### merge\_pairs.pl

This is a helper script to `make_bed.sh` that combines proper pairs into a
single fragment, and separates discordant pairs into single end reads. The
lengths of the single end reads are extended by half the mean fragment size,
which is determined from the data itself. The extended length is sampled from a
normal distribution using the mean and standard deviation of the measured fragment sizes.

METHODOLOGY ARTICLE Open Access
High resolution measurement of DUF1220
domain copy number from whole genome
sequence data
David P. Astling1, Ilea E. Heft1, Kenneth L. Jones2and James M. Sikela1*
Abstract
Background: DUF1220 protein domains found primarily in Neuroblastoma BreakPoint Family ( NBPF ) genes show
the greatest human lineage-specific increase in copy number of any coding region in the genome. There are 302
haploid copies of DUF1220 in hg38 (~160 of which are human-specific) and the majority of these can be divided
into 6 different subtypes (referred to as clades). Copy number changes of specific DUF1220 clades have been
associated in a dose-dependent manner with brain size variation (both evolutionarily and within the human
population), cognitive aptitude, autism severity, and schizophrenia severity. However, no published methods can
directly measure copies of DUF1220 with high accuracy and no method can distinguish between domains within
a clade.
Results: Here we describe a novel method for measuring copies of DUF1220 domains and the NBPF genes in
which they are found from whole genome sequence data. We have characterized the effect that various
sequencing and alignment parameters and strategies have on the accuracy and precision of the method and
defined the parameters that lead to optimal DUF1220 copy number measurement and resolution. We show that
copy number estimates obtained using our read depth approach are highly correlated with those generated by
ddPCR for three representative DUF1220 clades. By simulation, we demonstrate that our method provides sufficient
resolution to analyze DUF1220 copy number variation at three levels: (1) DUF1220 clade copy number within
individual genes and groups of genes (gene-specific clade groups) (2) genome wide DUF1220 clade copies and
(3) gene copy number for DUF1220-encoding genes.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first method to accurately measure copies of all six DUF1220 clades
and the first method to provide gene specific resolution of these clades. This allows one to discriminate among
the ~300 haploid human DUF1220 copies to an extent not possible with any other method. The result is a greatly
enhanced capability to analyze the role that these sequences play in human variation and disease.

Background
Highly duplicated sequences, including genes, are preva-
lent throughout the human genome [1]. While they have
been linked to important evolutionary [2, 3] and medical
phenotypes [4], they often go unexamined in studies of
genetic disease due to their complexity. Thus, there is a
growing need to develop improved strategies for accuratecopy number determination of highly duplicated se-
quences. While a number of methods exist for scoring
copy number variations (CNVs) (e.g. array comparative
genomic hybridization (arrayCGH), SNP arrays, qPCR,
ddPCR and read depth from exome sequencing) these
methods are not ideal for high-resolution measurement of
DUF1220 domains due to limitations in throughput, ac-
curacy and/or coverage. The primary challenge for both
array based methods and exome sequencing lies in the
hybridization efficiency of each probe with its respective
target and thus causing variance and resulting uneven* Correspondence: james.sikela@ucdenver.edu
