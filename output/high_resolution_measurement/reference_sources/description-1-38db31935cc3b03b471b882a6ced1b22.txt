High resolution measurement of DUF1220
domain copy number from whole genome
sequence data
David P. Astling1, Ilea E. Heft1, Kenneth L. Jones2and James M. Sikela1*
Abstract
Background: DUF1220 protein domains found primarily in Neuroblastoma BreakPoint Family ( NBPF ) genes show
the greatest human lineage-specific increase in copy number of any coding region in the genome. There are 302
haploid copies of DUF1220 in hg38 (~160 of which are human-specific) and the majority of these can be divided
into 6 different subtypes (referred to as clades). Copy number changes of specific DUF1220 clades have been
associated in a dose-dependent manner with brain size variation (both evolutionarily and within the human
population), cognitive aptitude, autism severity, and schizophrenia severity. However, no published methods can
directly measure copies of DUF1220 with high accuracy and no method can distinguish between domains within
a clade.
Results: Here we describe a novel method for measuring copies of DUF1220 domains and the NBPF genes in
which they are found from whole genome sequence data. We have characterized the effect that various
sequencing and alignment parameters and strategies have on the accuracy and precision of the method and
defined the parameters that lead to optimal DUF1220 copy number measurement and resolution. We show that
copy number estimates obtained using our read depth approach are highly correlated with those generated by
ddPCR for three representative DUF1220 clades. By simulation, we demonstrate that our method provides sufficient
resolution to analyze DUF1220 copy number variation at three levels: (1) DUF1220 clade copy number within
individual genes and groups of genes (gene-specific clade groups) (2) genome wide DUF1220 clade copies and
(3) gene copy number for DUF1220-encoding genes.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first method to accurately measure copies of all six DUF1220 clades
and the first method to provide gene specific resolution of these clades. This allows one to discriminate among
the ~300 haploid human DUF1220 copies to an extent not possible with any other method. The result is a greatly
enhanced capability to analyze the role that these sequences play in human variation and disease.

Background
Highly duplicated sequences, including genes, are preva-
lent throughout the human genome [1]. While they have
been linked to important evolutionary [2, 3] and medical
phenotypes [4], they often go unexamined in studies of
genetic disease due to their complexity. Thus, there is a
growing need to develop improved strategies for accuratecopy number determination of highly duplicated se-
quences. While a number of methods exist for scoring
copy number variations (CNVs) (e.g. array comparative
genomic hybridization (arrayCGH), SNP arrays, qPCR,
ddPCR and read depth from exome sequencing) these
methods are not ideal for high-resolution measurement of
DUF1220 domains due to limitations in throughput, ac-
curacy and/or coverage. The primary challenge for both
array based methods and exome sequencing lies in the
hybridization efficiency of each probe with its respective
target and thus causing variance and resulting uneven* Correspondence: james.sikela@ucdenver.edu

analysis as their domains may have impacts not related
to their coding potential (e.g. substrates for homolo-
gous recombination, targets of DNA or RNA binding
proteins). Application of the method described in this
paper to future analysis of variation and disease associ-
ations allows one to measure the DUF1220 domains of
pseudogenes separately from those that are predicted to
be protein-encoding.
To develop our methodology for measuring DUF1220
copies, we wanted to determine the extent to which this
read alignment ambiguity occurs. We carried out a
simulation in which 100 bp paired-end reads from each
DUF1220 domain were generated from the human ref-
erence genome, hg38, and aligned back to the reference
to determine the extent to which reads from each do-
main (CON1, CON2, CON3, HLS1, HLS2, and HLS3)
selectively align to the correct gene and clade. We
found that, with 100 bp paired-end reads, the DUF1220
sequences from eight genes can be uniquely measured;
100% of the reads originating from them align to the
originating gene and clade (e.g. NBPF7 ) (Fig. 2). In
other cases, a proportion of the reads align equally well
to two or more genes that have high sequence similarity
(e.g. NBPF4, NBPF5P & NBPF6) (Fig. 2). Simulations
involving 300 and 600 bp paired-end reads could not
resolve the domains within NBPF4 ,NBPF5P ,a n d
NBPF6 . If not accounted for, this read alignment ambi-
guity would result in over- o r under- estimates of gene-
specific clade copy number.
To address the challenge of read alignment ambiguity,
we observed from our simulation that show read sharing
is restricted to small clusters of genes and not distrib-
uted across all genes. By grouping related genes together
for analysis, one can maintain accuracy and improve our
resolution of copies within a clade. For example, we cal-
culate the number of CON1 domains from NBPF4,
NBPF5, and NBPF6 together because they share a high
percentage of their reads. Likewise, domains from
NBPF10, NBPF14, NBPF19, and NBPF20 share align-
ment ambiguity, so copies for these genes can be aggre-
gated. As described below, this approach substantially
reduces the error in copy number measurement. Add-
itional file 1: Table S1 shows a strategy for grouping re-
lated genes into 60 categories based on the results from
the simulated data for 100 bp paired end reads (Fig. 2).
While grouping genes with high read sharing reduces
resolution, the level of resolution obtainable with 100 bp
paired-end reads is still an improvement over existing
methods. The most appropriate gene groups to use for
any given analysis will depend on the goals of the re-
searcher (e.g. whether accuracy or resolution is a priority)
and the sequence data available, as longer paired-end
reads should improve the ability to localize reads to the
correct gene (and vice versa for shorter sequencing reads).Establishment of four levels of DUF1220 measurement
Based on the read alignment ambiguity shown in Fig. 2,
we differentiated four levels of resolution at which
DUF1220 copy number can be measured; 1) Domain level
measures are of each individual DUF1220 domain, i.e.
alignment to a precise genomic location, 2) Gene-specific
clade level measures are of all domains from a particular
clade that occur within each DUF1220-encoding gene, i.e.
reads align to a particular clade within an NBPF gene
(Additional file 1: Table S1) 3) Group-specific measures
are of all domains from a particular clade that occur
within gene grouping as described above (Additional file
1: Table S1), 4) Clade-specific measures are all DUF1220
domains belonging to each of the 6 different DUF1220
clades.
Evaluation of read length and paired-end reads on
quantification of DUF1220 copies
In order to measure DUF1220 copies, we need to deter-
mine which kind of sequencing data would be most ap-
plicable and how sequencing parameters may influence
the accuracy and precision of the measurement. Previ-
ous strategies have relied on very short 36 bp reads, we
hypothesized that longer re ads would improve accuracy
of copy number prediction.

Assignment of DUF1220 domains to appropriate clade
As previously described, the majority of DUF1220 do-
mains can be divided into 6 clades [10]. The domains of
each clade can be distinguished by their position within
the gene, their exon lengths (Additional file 5), and pro-
tein sequence motifs unique to each clade (Additional file
6). We assigned each DUF1220 domain to a clade based
on the presence or absence of these characteristic protein
sequence motifs. The validity of our clade assignments
can be confirmed by viewing a phylogenetic tree of the
protein sequences (Fig. 1). Furthermore, because the
amino-acid motifs particular to each clade are highly
conserved within clades, it is easy to view the distinctions
between clades by viewing the aligned protein sequences
(Additional file 6).
Some (16/302) DUF1220 domains do not fit well
within the previously established clades, but clearly
form 5 distinct clusters based on sequence similarity.
We have therefore established five new clades referred
to as CON4 –8 (Additional file 5). In contrast to the
domains belonging to the six clades described above,
the majority of these DUF1220 domains are located be-
tween 1p11.2 and 1p13.3. These were not analyzed in
this study because of their non-canonical nature and
their locations predominately within non- NBPF genes.
A few (6/302) DUF1220 domains appear to be hybrid
domains, that is, they contain a short exon characteris-
tic of one domain and the long exon characteristic of a
different domain. These domains were not included in
our analysis.
Individual DUF1220 domains are referred to by their
gene name, the name of the clade to which the domain
belongs, and a number reflecting the placement of that
domain within the gene. For example, NBPF1_CON1_3
refers to the third CON1 domain within NBPF1 and
NBPF20_HLS1_8 refers to the eighth HLS1 domain
within NBPF20 . Six DUF1220 containing genes currently
lack formal gene names in either RefSeq or Ensembl but
each of these has high sequence similarity to another
gene (e.g. LOC102724250 is very similar to NBPF1 ). For
clarity, in Additional file 5 and Additional file 2: Figure S1,
we refer to these genes by descriptive names reflecting
their similarity to named genes (LOC102724250: NBPF1L,
LOC100996724: PDE4DIPL1 , RP11-744H18.1: PDE4-
DIPL2 ). The three genes containing CON8 domains are
similar to one another but not to any currently named
gene, so they are referred to as CON8 containing 1, 2, and
3 (LOC105369199: CON8C1, LOC105369140: CON8C2 ,
LINC00869: CON8C3 ). In Additional file 5 we also label
some exons as conserved exon 1 –7 (CE1-CE7) because
the sequence of these exons is highly conserved across
genes and, for CE1-CE3, at multiple locations within
genes. Several non-coding exons also have high sequence
similarity across genes and these are labeled UTR1-UTR20 (e.g. the sequence of UTR13 exons is highly con-
served across different genes). Exons that do not meet any
of the conditions described above are referred to as “exon ”
with a number denoting the exon position in the gene.
Measurement of DUF1220 by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)
We performed ddPCR essentially as previously described
[17] to validate our copy number estimates for three rep-
resentative DUF1220 clades. DNA samples were obtained
from Coriell Biorepository and digested with the restric-
tion enzyme DDE1. Digested DNA, primers, and fluores-
cently labeled probes were then combined following the
manufacturer ’s protocol.
