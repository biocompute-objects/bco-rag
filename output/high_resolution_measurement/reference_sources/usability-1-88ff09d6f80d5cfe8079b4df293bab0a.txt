METHODOLOGY ARTICLE Open Access
High resolution measurement of DUF1220
domain copy number from whole genome
sequence data
David P. Astling1, Ilea E. Heft1, Kenneth L. Jones2and James M. Sikela1*
Abstract
Background: DUF1220 protein domains found primarily in Neuroblastoma BreakPoint Family ( NBPF ) genes show
the greatest human lineage-specific increase in copy number of any coding region in the genome. There are 302
haploid copies of DUF1220 in hg38 (~160 of which are human-specific) and the majority of these can be divided
into 6 different subtypes (referred to as clades). Copy number changes of specific DUF1220 clades have been
associated in a dose-dependent manner with brain size variation (both evolutionarily and within the human
population), cognitive aptitude, autism severity, and schizophrenia severity. However, no published methods can
directly measure copies of DUF1220 with high accuracy and no method can distinguish between domains within
a clade.
Results: Here we describe a novel method for measuring copies of DUF1220 domains and the NBPF genes in
which they are found from whole genome sequence data. We have characterized the effect that various
sequencing and alignment parameters and strategies have on the accuracy and precision of the method and
defined the parameters that lead to optimal DUF1220 copy number measurement and resolution. We show that
copy number estimates obtained using our read depth approach are highly correlated with those generated by
ddPCR for three representative DUF1220 clades. By simulation, we demonstrate that our method provides sufficient
resolution to analyze DUF1220 copy number variation at three levels: (1) DUF1220 clade copy number within
individual genes and groups of genes (gene-specific clade groups) (2) genome wide DUF1220 clade copies and
(3) gene copy number for DUF1220-encoding genes.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first method to accurately measure copies of all six DUF1220 clades
and the first method to provide gene specific resolution of these clades. This allows one to discriminate among
the ~300 haploid human DUF1220 copies to an extent not possible with any other method. The result is a greatly
enhanced capability to analyze the role that these sequences play in human variation and disease.

Background
Highly duplicated sequences, including genes, are preva-
lent throughout the human genome [1]. While they have
been linked to important evolutionary [2, 3] and medical
phenotypes [4], they often go unexamined in studies of
genetic disease due to their complexity. Thus, there is a
growing need to develop improved strategies for accuratecopy number determination of highly duplicated se-
quences. While a number of methods exist for scoring
copy number variations (CNVs) (e.g. array comparative
genomic hybridization (arrayCGH), SNP arrays, qPCR,
ddPCR and read depth from exome sequencing) these
methods are not ideal for high-resolution measurement of
DUF1220 domains due to limitations in throughput, ac-
curacy and/or coverage. The primary challenge for both
array based methods and exome sequencing lies in the
hybridization efficiency of each probe with its respective
target and thus causing variance and resulting uneven* Correspondence: james.sikela@ucdenver.edu

Assignment of DUF1220 domains to appropriate clade
As previously described, the majority of DUF1220 do-
mains can be divided into 6 clades [10]. The domains of
each clade can be distinguished by their position within
the gene, their exon lengths (Additional file 5), and pro-
tein sequence motifs unique to each clade (Additional file
6). We assigned each DUF1220 domain to a clade based
on the presence or absence of these characteristic protein
sequence motifs. The validity of our clade assignments
can be confirmed by viewing a phylogenetic tree of the
protein sequences (Fig. 1). Furthermore, because the
amino-acid motifs particular to each clade are highly
conserved within clades, it is easy to view the distinctions
between clades by viewing the aligned protein sequences
(Additional file 6).
Some (16/302) DUF1220 domains do not fit well
within the previously established clades, but clearly
form 5 distinct clusters based on sequence similarity.
We have therefore established five new clades referred
to as CON4 –8 (Additional file 5). In contrast to the
domains belonging to the six clades described above,
the majority of these DUF1220 domains are located be-
tween 1p11.2 and 1p13.3. These were not analyzed in
this study because of their non-canonical nature and
their locations predominately within non- NBPF genes.
A few (6/302) DUF1220 domains appear to be hybrid
domains, that is, they contain a short exon characteris-
tic of one domain and the long exon characteristic of a
different domain. These domains were not included in
our analysis.
Individual DUF1220 domains are referred to by their
gene name, the name of the clade to which the domain
belongs, and a number reflecting the placement of that
domain within the gene. For example, NBPF1_CON1_3
refers to the third CON1 domain within NBPF1 and
NBPF20_HLS1_8 refers to the eighth HLS1 domain
within NBPF20 . Six DUF1220 containing genes currently
lack formal gene names in either RefSeq or Ensembl but
each of these has high sequence similarity to another
gene (e.g. LOC102724250 is very similar to NBPF1 ). For
clarity, in Additional file 5 and Additional file 2: Figure S1,
we refer to these genes by descriptive names reflecting
their similarity to named genes (LOC102724250: NBPF1L,
LOC100996724: PDE4DIPL1 , RP11-744H18.1: PDE4-
DIPL2 ). The three genes containing CON8 domains are
similar to one another but not to any currently named
gene, so they are referred to as CON8 containing 1, 2, and
3 (LOC105369199: CON8C1, LOC105369140: CON8C2 ,
LINC00869: CON8C3 ). In Additional file 5 we also label
some exons as conserved exon 1 –7 (CE1-CE7) because
the sequence of these exons is highly conserved across
genes and, for CE1-CE3, at multiple locations within
genes. Several non-coding exons also have high sequence
similarity across genes and these are labeled UTR1-UTR20 (e.g. the sequence of UTR13 exons is highly con-
served across different genes). Exons that do not meet any
of the conditions described above are referred to as “exon ”
with a number denoting the exon position in the gene.
Measurement of DUF1220 by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)
We performed ddPCR essentially as previously described
[17] to validate our copy number estimates for three rep-
resentative DUF1220 clades. DNA samples were obtained
from Coriell Biorepository and digested with the restric-
tion enzyme DDE1. Digested DNA, primers, and fluores-
cently labeled probes were then combined following the
manufacturer ’s protocol.
