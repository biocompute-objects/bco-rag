High resolution measurement of DUF1220
domain copy number from whole genome
sequence data
David P. Astling1, Ilea E. Heft1, Kenneth L. Jones2and James M. Sikela1*
Abstract
Background: DUF1220 protein domains found primarily in Neuroblastoma BreakPoint Family ( NBPF ) genes show
the greatest human lineage-specific increase in copy number of any coding region in the genome. There are 302
haploid copies of DUF1220 in hg38 (~160 of which are human-specific) and the majority of these can be divided
into 6 different subtypes (referred to as clades). Copy number changes of specific DUF1220 clades have been
associated in a dose-dependent manner with brain size variation (both evolutionarily and within the human
population), cognitive aptitude, autism severity, and schizophrenia severity. However, no published methods can
directly measure copies of DUF1220 with high accuracy and no method can distinguish between domains within
a clade.
Results: Here we describe a novel method for measuring copies of DUF1220 domains and the NBPF genes in
which they are found from whole genome sequence data. We have characterized the effect that various
sequencing and alignment parameters and strategies have on the accuracy and precision of the method and
defined the parameters that lead to optimal DUF1220 copy number measurement and resolution. We show that
copy number estimates obtained using our read depth approach are highly correlated with those generated by
ddPCR for three representative DUF1220 clades. By simulation, we demonstrate that our method provides sufficient
resolution to analyze DUF1220 copy number variation at three levels: (1) DUF1220 clade copy number within
individual genes and groups of genes (gene-specific clade groups) (2) genome wide DUF1220 clade copies and
(3) gene copy number for DUF1220-encoding genes.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first method to accurately measure copies of all six DUF1220 clades
and the first method to provide gene specific resolution of these clades. This allows one to discriminate among
the ~300 haploid human DUF1220 copies to an extent not possible with any other method. The result is a greatly
enhanced capability to analyze the role that these sequences play in human variation and disease.

Background
Highly duplicated sequences, including genes, are preva-
lent throughout the human genome [1]. While they have
been linked to important evolutionary [2, 3] and medical
phenotypes [4], they often go unexamined in studies of
genetic disease due to their complexity. Thus, there is a
growing need to develop improved strategies for accuratecopy number determination of highly duplicated se-
quences. While a number of methods exist for scoring
copy number variations (CNVs) (e.g. array comparative
genomic hybridization (arrayCGH), SNP arrays, qPCR,
ddPCR and read depth from exome sequencing) these
methods are not ideal for high-resolution measurement of
DUF1220 domains due to limitations in throughput, ac-
curacy and/or coverage. The primary challenge for both
array based methods and exome sequencing lies in the
hybridization efficiency of each probe with its respective
target and thus causing variance and resulting uneven* Correspondence: james.sikela@ucdenver.edu

The data shown in Table 1 illustrate the accuracy of the
copy number estimation based on simulated reads from
all canonical DUF1220 domains aligned to the reference.
The simulation was conducted ten times and the mea-
sured number of copies was compared with the known
copies. This allows for the quantitative comparison of ‘off-
target ’alignment rates at the level of domain, gene, group
and clade shown in Table 2.
Overall the ‘best ’alignment strategy outperformed
the other methods. For 566 total diploid DUF1220 cop-
ies, the ‘best ’alignment method was off by an average
of 3.7 copies, the multiread correction method was off
by 7.7, and the total alignment strategies were off by
hundreds of copies. While the multiread correction
method was competitive in terms of accuracy, it was
the least computationally efficient. The ‘Align All ’
method with mrsFast [26] performed better for CON2
than with other domains, which is likely due to the
conservation of the sequence across genes. If NBPF3 ,

CON2 estimate by ‘Align All ’drops to 0.08, which is
lower than the ‘best ’alignment strategy.
While the ‘Align All ’strategy was good at summarizing
copies of CON1 and CON2 at the clade level, where 0%
of the reads were found as off-target alignment, it lacked
the ability to resolve copy number estimates below the
clade level (e.g. if an extra CON2 domain was detected
at the clade level, it would be difficult to tell from which
gene it came) (Table 2). The ‘Align All ’strategy underes-
timated CON1 copy number, which is likely caused by
reads not uniformly aligning to all domains (Fig. 5). For
clades CON3, HLS1, HLS2 and HLS3, the ‘Align All ’
strategy had a much higher off-target percentage than
the ‘Best Align ’strategy (25 –40% vs 0.5 –7%) and the es-
timated copy numbers were higher than expected. This
is likely due to the sequence similarity between CON3
and the HLS clades. Thus, it is likely that HLS domains
inflated the measure of CON3 and of themselves. The
ambiguity among HLS domains was much higher when
using the Bowtie1 for the ‘Align All ’strategy. If we
normalize the HLS clades by the total number of HLS1,
HLS2, HLS3 copies, we can reduce the observed error to
46.8 overall DUF1220 copies. While the overall accuracy
increases, it comes at the cost of distinguishing betweenHLS clades. Perhaps with an improved normalization
scheme, the error in the copy number estimates from
the ‘Align All ’strategies could be further reduced, how-
ever it is unlikely to be able to distinguish beyond the
clade level.
Validation by ddPCR
The accuracy of our read depth method, and the ability
to detect changes in copy number, were evaluated by
comparing the read depth generated copy numbers of
three DUF1220 clades (CON1, CON2 and HLS3) with
the copy numbers measured by ddPCR (Fig. 6). We
believe these three subtypes provide the best validation
for the WGS estimates for the following reasons. Previ-
ously published ddPCR data for CON1 [17 –19], CON2
[20], and HLS1 [17 –19] suggested that measuring
CON1, CON2, and one of the HLS clades would capture
the range of copy numbers seen by all 6 DUF1220
clades. Any one of the HLS clades is likely to have a very
similar copy number range as the others because, in
hg38, they almost always occur as a triplet. HLS3 was
chosen to represent the HLS clades for validation of our
method because it has a lower off-target alignment rate
than HLS1 and HLS2 (Table 2) Likewise, the off target
alignments for CON1 and CON2 are zero at the clade
level which make them ideal candidates for comparison.
We have previously optimized the use of ddPCR for meas-
urement of DUF1220 clade copy number and shown that
the method is highly reproducible [17, 18, 20]. Because of
batch effects between sequencing centers, we measured
the Pearson correlation coefficients for each center
separately.
As shown in Fig. 6, we observed high correlation
coefficients for samples from the Max Plank Institute for
Molecular Genetics (MPIMG) and the Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute (SC) for all three clades. The p-valuesTable 1 The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the alignment
